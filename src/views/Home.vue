        As dirty, heavy, and looming as the desert landform that takes their name, the Mesa Divide formed in the fall of 2019. The Mesa Divide is comprised of three musicians who are no stranger to the local scene (Members of SpaceEagle, Lanedecay, Ashes (Chicago) ). Their influences pull from the desert rock scene of the 1990s, thrash classics, and stoner-doom. The result is a sound that is as crushing as it is melodic.
